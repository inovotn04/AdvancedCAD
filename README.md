### The Deck

#### Reflection
The deck went incredibly smoothly I had no problems with it nor could I really anticipate any obvious problems.

### The Trucks

#### Reflection
The trucks WOULD have gone smoothly but there was some random problem with the holes not being there, I literally do not know how I fixed it, however the advice I can give is to make sure the holes are there BEFORE moving on because otherwise you have to roll it back and stuff and it's just a big pain.

### The Wheel and Bearing

#### Reflection
The wheels and bearings went really smoothly as well, the measurements for the bearings are bit weird I suppose? So just make sure you get those right.

### Assembly

#### Reflection

Assemblies are always easy peasy especially since onshape makes it so easy. The one problem is mating screws is really finicky however that's mostly just a time thing and less of an actual problem to figure out.
